# Introduction

InnerEye-DICOM-RT contains tools to convert medical datasets in NIFTI format to DICOM-RT. Datasets converted using
this tool can be consumed directly by [InnerEye-DeepLearning](https://github.com/microsoft/InnerEye-DeepLearning).

Most of the work is done by a .NET Core 2.1 project in RTConvert, written in C#. There is a very lightweight wrapper
around this so that it can be consumed from Python. The wrapper relies on the PyPI package https://pypi.org/project/dotnetcore2/ which wraps up .NET Core 2.1.

## Installing

### Git for Windows

Get the installer from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

 The installer will prompt you to "Select Components". Make sure that you tick

* Git LFS (Large File Support)
* Git Credential Manager for Windows

After the installation, open a command prompt or the Git Bash:

* Run `git lfs install` to set up the hooks in git
* Run `git config --global core.autocrlf true` to ensure that line endings are working as expected

Clone the InnerEye-DICOM-RT repository on your machine: Run `git lfs clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/InnerEye-DICOM-RT`

### Visual Studio / .NET Core

The C# components can be built with the .NET Core SDK. We use version 2.1 for compatibility with the PyPI package `dotnetcore2`.
 Installation instructions are here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/.
Visual Studio is not required to build, but if you wish to use it then for .Net Core 2.1 you need at least:
[Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/?utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=docs.microsoft.com&utm_campaign=inline+link).

### RTConvert

RTConvert can be built from a .NET Core command line:

```bash
dotnet build RTConvert
```

There are unit tests:

```bash
dotnet test RTConvert
```

Note that the unit tests have a dependency on `System.Drawing` and that on Linux `System.Drawing` requires a native package:

```bash
apt-get -s install libgdiplus
```

Finally, for consumption by the Python wrapper, this solution must be published:

```bash
dotnet publish RTConvert --configuration Release -p:Platform=x64
```

This should create a folder with all the requirements for RTConvert at:
`RTConvert/Microsoft.RTConvert.Console/bin/x64/Release/netcoreapp2.1/publish/*`

### Echo

Echo is a very simple application that takes 1 or 2 arguments. The first is echoed to `stdout`, and if a
second argument is supplied then it is echoed to `stderr`. This is only required for units tests to establish
that a .NET Core application can be called.

Echo can be built from a .NET Core command line:

```bash
dotnet build Echo
```

There are no unit tests.

Finally, for consumption by the Python wrapper, this solution must be published:

```bash
dotnet publish Echo --configuration Release -p:Platform=x64
```

This should create a folder with all the requirements for Echo at: `Echo/Echo/bin/x64/Release/netcoreapp2.1/publish/*`

## Python

The Python wrapper is in `src/InnerEye_DICOM_RT/nifti_to_dicom_rt_converter.py`. It simply uses `subprocess.Popen` to invoke
the .NET Core application passing in the relevant dll and command line arguments.

It does require that the RTConvert and Echo published packages are copied to the folder: `src/InnerEye_DICOM_RT/bin/netcoreapp2.1`.

Note that the github build action does this automatically, but if testing then this needs to be done
manually.

The Python package is created with:

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

which builds a source distribution and wheel to the `dist` folder.

To run the Python tests:

```bash
pip install pytest dotnetcore2
pytest tests
```

## Usage

To consume this package:

```bash
pip install InnerEye-DICOM-RT
```

To call RTConvert:

```python
    from InnerEye_DICOM_RT.nifti_to_dicom_rt_converter import rtconvert

    (stdout, stderr) = rtconvert(
        in_file=NiftiSegmentationLocation,
        reference_series=DicomVolumeLocation,
        out_file=OutputFile,
        struct_names=StructureNames,
        struct_colors=StructureColors,
        fill_holes=FillHoles,
        roi_interpreted_types=ROIInterpretedTypes,
        manufacturer=Manufacturer,
        interpreter=Interpreter,
        modelId=ModelId
    )
```

where:

* `in_file` is the path to the input Nifti file. This file is a 3D volume in [Nifti format](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/).
* `reference_series` is the path to the input folder containing the reference DICOM series;
* `out_file` is the path to the output DICOM-RT file;
* `struct_names` is a list of structure names like: ["External", "parotid_l", "parotid_r", "smg_l"].
    Each structure name corresponds to a non-zero voxel value in the input volume. In the example External corresponds to voxel
    value 1, parotid_l to 2, etc. Voxels with value 0 are dropped.
    If there are voxels without a corresponding structure name, they will also be dropped.
    The structure name will become its ROI Name in the Structure Set ROI Sequence in the Structure Set in the DICOM-RT file.
* `struct_colors` is a list of structure colors in hexadecimal notation like: ["000000", "FF0080", "00FF00", "0000FF"].
    Each color in this list corresponds to a structure in struct_names and will become its ROI Display Color
    in the ROI Contour Sequence in the ROI Contour in the DICOM-RT file.
    If there are less colors than struct_names, or if an entry is empty, the default is red (FF0000);
* `fill_holes` is a list of bools like: [True, False, True].
    If there are less bools than struct_names, or if an entry is empty, the default is false.
    If True then any contours found per slice will have their holes filled, otherwise contours will be returned
    as found.
* `modelId` Model name and version from AzureML. E.g. Prostate:123
* `manufacturer` Manufacturer for the DICOM-RT (check DICOM-RT documentation)
* `interpreter` Interpreter for the DICOM-RT (check DICOM-RT documentation)
* `roi_interpreted_types` is a list of ROIInterpretedType. Possible values (None, CTV, ORGAN, EXTERNAL).

### Segmentation Timestamps

In the process of converting from NIFTI masks to DICOM, InnerEye-DICOM-RT adds a timestamp tag to the series. This timestamp will be set to the ***local time of the compute resource that `rtconvert()` is run on***. This is as some DICOM readers do not handle timezones / UTC offsets from these tags and will result in erroneous times being displayed. Therefore, if your compute resource is running in a different timezone to the timezone you are viewing the DICOM files in, the timestamps may not be what you are expecting.
